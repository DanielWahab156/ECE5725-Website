        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          Modern consumer products such as vocoders and music recognition software rely heavily on digital signal
          processing. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a technique used to analyze and transform audio input. As will
          be explained later, there are multiple methods of achieving this as creating a sound for human ears is simple
          as long as you can trick the brain. In this project, we wanted to explore areas where digital signal
          processing is commonly used. We do this by creating a 3-mode audio processing system where each mode takes on
          a different task. These modes can be navigated by the user using our interactive piTFT GUI. Through this
          project we gained a greater understanding of DSP and explored some of the avenues it's commonly used in.

        <h2>Software Design</h2>
        <h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          The program's architecture uses a modular, multi-threaded structure in which each of the three modes is
          encapsulated in its own file. Each mode renders to its own "fake screen," an off-screen pygame surface that
          holds mode-specific visuals. A single main file handles all actual drawing to the piTFT display, ensuring that
          rendering remains consistent and without concurrency issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          At program startup, the system displays a splash screen. This screen acts as an entry point and provides two
          methods of navigation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The user may tap the screen to continue to the switch-screen.</li>
          <li>Three piTFT buttons are mapped to instantly launch their corresponding modes directly from the splash
            screen, bypassing the switch-screen entirely. A fourth button is reserved for exiting the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The switch screen presents live previews of all three modes. These previews come directly from the fake
          screens each mode continuously updates. When a mode is chosen, either through the touch interface or via
          button press, the system starts a dedicated thread to run that mode's internal logic. All rendering, however,
          remains centralized on the main thread to avoid graphical race conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a mode's logic thread begins running, the mode's fake screen is rendered directly to the screen and the
          user can interact with the mode with the touchscreen. A "switch" button is rendered at the bottom-right of the
          mode screen that returns to the switch screen when pressed. If pressed, the mode continues updating its fake
          screen in the background, allowing the switch-screen to display a live, continuously updated preview. A mode's
          thread persists until the user switches to another mode, at which point the existing thread is terminated and
          replaced with a new one corresponding to the selected mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          The piTFT buttons remain active throughout the program. At any time, each of the three mode buttons can
          directly switch to their associated mode, stopping the current logic thread and launching the new one. The
          dedicated exit button terminates the program cleanly from any screen.
        </p>

        <h3>Song Detection</h3>
        <p>
          The song detection mode leverages the existing abracadabra sound detection library to effectively identify
          songs playing in the background. With many modifications, this mode ensures that only precise matches are
          detected, minimizing false positives. Key improvements include the introduction of stricter criteria for song
          matching, which helps filter out noises that might otherwise be mistaken for a match. Additionally, a sliding
          window approach has been implemented for processing audio, which mitigates the risk of one-off audio errors
          skewing the detection results. This dynamic method allows for continuous, real-time analysis, improving
          overall detection reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          To optimize performance on the resource-constrained Raspberry Pi, significant changes were made to how audio
          data is captured and processed. A callback-based approach was implemented to mitigate input overflows and,
          when overflows happen, filter out affected data chunks. These adjustments ensure smoother real-time operation.
          Furthermore, storage optimizations were integrated to reduce the storage footprint of each detected song,
          while still maintaining a high level of accuracy.
        </p>

        <h3>Vocal Modulation</h3>
        <p>
          Implements real-time audio effects including pitch shifting (0.5x to 1.5x), echo (250ms delay with decay), and
          reverb (multiple delayed echoes). Uses scipy's signal processing for pitch modification and custom algorithms
          for temporal effects.
        </p>

        <h3>Pitch Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Utilizes librosa's piptrack method for accurate pitch detection. Converts detected frequencies to musical
          notes (C-B across octaves) and displays both Hz and note name in real-time. Optimized for vocal frequency
          range (50-2000 Hz).

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>Mode 1 Testing:</strong> Song detection was tested with a database of 20 popular songs. Recognition
          accuracy was tested at various distances (1-3 feet) and noise levels. The system achieved 85% accuracy in
          quiet environments and 60% in noisy conditions. Album artwork loading and display was verified for all
          database entries.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>Mode 2 Testing:</strong> Vocal effects were tested with different voice types and pitch ranges. Pitch
          shifting maintained audio quality across the 0.5x-1.5x range. Echo and reverb effects were tuned to avoid
          excessive feedback. Memory management was optimized to prevent crashes during 3-5 second recordings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>Mode 3 Testing:</strong> Pitch detection was validated against a calibrated tuner across the vocal
          range. Frequency accuracy was within ±2 Hz for stable tones. Note name detection correctly handled all 12
          chromatic notes across 3 octaves. Response time was under 100ms for clear signals.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>System Testing:</strong> Mode switching was tested extensively to ensure clean thread termination and
          resource cleanup. The GUI remained responsive during audio processing. Hardware buttons provided reliable
          backup navigation throughout testing.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          The Multi-Purpose Microphone successfully demonstrates three distinct DSP applications in a unified system.
          Song detection identifies familiar tracks within 8-15 seconds with good accuracy. Vocal modulation provides
          real-time audio effects that are fun and engaging. The pitch detector serves as a functional tuner for musical
          instruments and voice training.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          The modular architecture proved effective, allowing independent development and testing of each mode. The GUI
          provides intuitive navigation with both touchscreen and hardware button controls. The system runs smoothly on
          the Raspberry Pi 4, maintaining responsive user interaction even during intensive audio processing.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          Performance metrics: Mode 1 achieves song identification in 8-15 seconds. Mode 2 processes and plays back
          audio with effects in under 4 seconds. Mode 3 provides pitch detection updates at approximately 10 Hz. The
          entire system maintains 60 FPS on the display while processing audio.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          This project successfully explored three key applications of digital signal processing: audio fingerprinting,
          real-time audio effects, and pitch detection. Each mode demonstrates different DSP techniques and algorithms,
          providing hands-on experience with frequency analysis, spectral manipulation, and pattern recognition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          The multi-threaded architecture with separate rendering and logic threads proved essential for maintaining
          smooth operation. PyGame's surface system enabled efficient previews and transitions between modes. Hardware
          integration with the PiTFT and USB microphone worked reliably throughout development.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          Key learnings included: the importance of memory management in embedded Python applications, trade-offs
          between audio quality and processing speed, and techniques for building responsive user interfaces during
          intensive computations. The project demonstrates that a Raspberry Pi 4 is capable of real-time audio
          processing for interactive applications.

        <h2>Work Distribution</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          We achieved an even split of work on the final project. In the first couple weeks, development was done
          individually as we both needed to research and test code for each mode. Nearing weeks 3-4, collaborative
          development integrated our mode logic onto the Pi and implemented the main menu and switching system.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>Daniel Wahab (dow26):</strong> Implemented Modes 2 and 3, including all GUI displays and audio
          processing logic. Developed the pitch shifting, echo, and reverb algorithms. Created the pitch detection
          system using librosa. Handled memory optimization and audio device management.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          <strong>Nagaa Dhaba (nd435):</strong> Implemented Mode 1 with song detection and fingerprinting. Designed the
          main menu, splash screen, and mode switching architecture. Developed the multi-threaded framework and
          rendering system. Created the neon UI elements and animations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          Both members contributed equally to testing, debugging, and documentation. The modular design allowed parallel
          development while maintaining system integration throughout the project.
